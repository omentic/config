# config

Configuration files for my computer.

This git repository is located inside of `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. Configuration files from other locations (ex. bashrc) are moved here and then symlinked out. The last versions of my configuration files before a big change (ex. switching distributions) are typically tagged.

Currently, I daily drive GNOME with the excellent [dash-to-panel extension](https://github.com/home-sweet-gnome/dash-to-panel), and maintain a [river](https://github.com/riverwm/river/) setup on the side. Previously, before switching to Wayland, I've used and liked [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) and [XFCE](https://xfce.org/). In the future, I've been meaning to write a bspwm-like layout generator for river, play around with [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), and possibly switch from GNOME to KDE.
